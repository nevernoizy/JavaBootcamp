# Chapter I
### Preamble
Reflection is a powerful mechanism that ensures the operation of frameworks (such as Spring or Hibernate). Knowledge of Java Reflection API operation principles guarantees the correct use of various technologies for implementing corporate systems.

Reflection tool enables to flexibly use class information during runtime, as well as dynamically change the state of objects without using this information in writing the source code.

One of reflection capabilities is modifying private field values from outside. We may ask then whether this contradicts the encapsulation principle, and <br>
the answer is no. :)

# Chapter II
### General Rules
- Use this page as your only reference. Do not listen to rumors and speculations about how to prepare your solution.
- There is only one Java version for you, 1.8. Make sure you have the compiler and interpreter for this version installed on your machine.
- You can use the IDE to write and debug the source code.
- The code is more often read than written. Carefully read the [document](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf) where code formatting rules are given. When performing any task, make sure you follow the generally accepted [Oracle Standards](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html).

- Comments are not allowed in the source code of your solution. They make it difficult to read the code.
- Be aware of the permissions of your files and directories.
- Your solution must be in your GIT repository to be evaluated.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your fellow bootcampers.
- You should not leave any files in your src directory other than those explicitly specified in the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your .gitignore to avoid accidents.
- If you need accurate output in your programs, it is forbidden to display precalculated output instead of running the exercise correctly.
- Got a question? Ask your neighbor to the right. Otherwise, try your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference guide: peers / Internet / Google. And one more thing. For every question you have, there's an answer on Stackoverflow. Learn how to ask questions properly.
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things not specified in the subject.
- Use System.out for output.
- And may the Force be with you!
- Never leave till tomorrow what you can do today. ;)

### Exercise 00 ‚Äì Work with Classes

Exercise 00: Work with Classes ||
---|---
Turn-in directory	| ex00
Files to turn-in |	Reflection-folder


Now you need to implement a Maven project that interacts with classes in your application. We need to create at least two classes, each with:
- private fields (supported types are String, Integer, Double, Boolean, Long);
- public methods;
- an empty constructor;
- a constructor with one parameter;
- toString() method.

You do not need to implement any get/set methods in this task. Newly created classes must be in a separate **classes** package (this package can be in other packages). Let's assume that the application has User and Car classes. The User class is described below:
```java
public class User {
   private String firstName;
   private String lastName;
   private int height;

   public User() {
       this.firstName = "Default first name";
       this.lastName = "Default last name";
       this.height = 0;
   }

   public User(String firstName, String lastName, int height) {
       this.firstName = firstName;
       this.lastName = lastName;
       this.height = height;
   }

   public int grow(int value) {
       this.height += value;
       return height;
   }

   @Override
   public String toString() {
       return new StringJoiner(", ", User.class.getSimpleName() + "[", "]")
               .add("firstName='" + firstName + "'")
               .add("lastName='" + lastName + "'")
               .add("height=" + height)
               .toString();
   }
}
```

The implemented application works as follows:
- Provide information about a class in a class package.
- Allow a user to create objects of a specified class with specific field values.
- Display information about the created class object.
- Call class methods.

An example of how the program works:

```
Classes:
  - User
  - Car
---------------------
Enter class name:
-> User
---------------------
fields:
	String firstName
	String lastName
	int height
methods:
	int grow(int)
---------------------
Let‚Äôs create an object.
firstName:
-> UserName
lastName:
-> UserSurname
height:
-> 185
Object created: User[firstName='UserName', lastName='UserSurname', height=185]
---------------------
Enter name of the field for changing:
-> firstName
Enter String value:
-> Name
Object updated: User[firstName='Name', lastName='UserSurname', height=185]
---------------------
Enter name of the method for call:
-> grow(int)
Enter int value:
-> 10
Method returned:
195
```

- If a method has more than one parameter, you must set values for each parameter.
- If the method is of void type, no return value line is displayed.
- In a program session, you can interact with only a single class, modify a single field of its object, and call a single method.
- You can use the throws operator.

# Chapter IV
### Exercise 01 ‚Äì Annotations ‚Äì SOURCE

Exercise 01: Annotations ‚Äì SOURCE ||
---|---
Turn-in directory |	ex01
Files to turn-in |	Annotations-folder

Annotations allow you to store metadata directly in your code. Now your goal is to implement HtmlProcessor class (derived fromAbstractProcessor) that will process classes with special @HtmlForm and @Htmlnput annotations and generate HTML form code inside the target/classes folder after running mvn clean compile command. Let's say we have a UserForm class:
```java
@HtmlForm(fileName = ‚Äúuser_form.html‚Äù, action = ‚Äú/users‚Äù, method = ‚Äúpost‚Äù)
public class UserForm {
	@HtmlInput(type = ‚Äútext‚Äù, name = ‚Äúfirst_name‚Äù, placeholder = ‚ÄúEnter First Name‚Äù)
	private String firstName;

	@HtmlInput(type = ‚Äútext‚Äù, name = ‚Äúlast_name‚Äù, placeholder = ‚ÄúEnter Last Name‚Äù)
	private String lastName;
	
	@HtmlInput(type = ‚Äúpassword‚Äù, name = ‚Äúpassword‚Äù, placeholder = ‚ÄúEnter Password‚Äù)
	private String password;
}
```
Then, it shall be used as a base to generate "user_form.html" file with the following contents:

```HTML
<form action = "/users" method = "post">
	<input type = "text" name = "first_name" placeholder = "Enter First Name">
	<input type = "text" name = "last_name" placeholder = "Enter Last Name">
	<input type = "password" name = "password" placeholder = "Enter Password">
	<input type = "submit" value = "Send">
</form>
```

- @HtmlForm and @HtmlInput annotations are only available during compilation.
- The project structure is at the discretion of the developer.
- To handle annotations correctly, we recommend using special settings of maven-compiler-plugin and auto-service dependency on com.google.auto.service.

# Chapter V
### Exercise 02 ‚Äì ORM

Exercise 02: ORM ||
---|---
Turn-in directory	| ex02
Files to turn-in	| ORM-folder

We have already mentioned that the Hibernate ORM framework for databases is based on reflection. The ORM concept allows to automatically map relational links to object-oriented links. This approach makes the application completely independent from DBMS. You need to implement a trivial version of such ORM framework.

Let's assume that we have a set of model classes. Each class has no dependencies on other classes, and its fields can accept only the following value types String, Integer, Double, Boolean, Long. Let's specify a certain set of annotations for the class and its members, for example, User class:

```java
@OrmEntity(table = ‚Äúsimple_user‚Äù)
public class User {
  @OrmColumnId
  private Long id;
  @OrmColumn(name = ‚Äúfirst_name‚Äù, length = 10)
  private String firstName;
  @OrmColumn(name = ‚Äúfirst_name‚Äù, length = 10)
  private String lastName;
  @OrmColumn(name ‚Äúage‚Äù)
  private Integer age;
  
  // setters/getters
}
```

Your OrmManager class will generate and execute SQL code during initialization of all classes marked with @OrmEntity annotation. This code will contain a CREATE TABLE command to create a table with the name specified in the annotation. Each field of the class marked with @OrmColumn annotation will become a column in this table. The field marked with the @OrmColumnId annotation indicates that an auto-incrementing identifier must be created. OrmManager also supports the following set of operations (for each of them, the corresponding SQL code is also generated at Runtime):

```java
public void save(Object entity)

public void update(Object entity)

public <T> T findById(Long id, Class<T> aClass)
```

- OrmManager should ensure that generated SQL is output to the console during execution.
- During initialization, OrmManager should remove generated tables.
- Update method replaces values in columns specified in the entity, even if the object field value is null.
